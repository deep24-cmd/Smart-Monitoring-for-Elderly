# Smart-Monitoring-for-Elderly
Gemini said This IoT-based system monitors heart rate (Pulse Sensor), temperature (LM35), and falls (PIR Sensor) for the elderly. Controlled by an Arduino Uno, it uses a SIM800L module to send emergency SMS alerts to caretakers. It features noise-filtering logic for accuracy and a 16x2 LCD for real-time local monitoring.
