1. Communication & Display Connections
These pins handle the sending of SMS alerts and the local display of data.

Component	Pin	Arduino Pin	Function
SIM800L Board	GND	GND	Critical: Connects 12V and 5V grounds.
SIM800L Board	TX	D2	Sends data from GSM to Arduino.
SIM800L Board	RX	D3	Receives data from Arduino.
I2C 16x2 LCD	GND	GND	Power ground.
I2C 16x2 LCD	VCC	5V	5V Power supply.
I2C 16x2 LCD	SDA	A4	Data line for I2C communication.
I2C 16x2 LCD	SCL	A5	Clock line for I2C communication.
2. Health & Safety Sensor Connections
These sensors capture the vital signs and movement of the individual.

Component	Pin	Arduino Pin	Function
LM35 (Temp)	Out (Mid)	A0	Analog input for body temperature.
Pulse Sensor	Signal (S)	A1	Analog input for heart rate.
PIR Sensor	Out (D)	D4	Digital input for motion/fall detection.
Buzzer	Pos (+)	D5	Digital output for emergency alarm.

3. Power Supply Setup
SIM800L Module: Use a 12V 2A Power Adapter plugged directly into the SIM800L power board. This is necessary to handle the high current bursts when the module transmits SMS.

Arduino Uno: Power the Arduino via the USB cable connected to your PC or a 9V battery.

Common Ground Rule: You must connect the GND of the SIM800L power board to the GND of the Arduino. Without this, the RX/TX signals will be corrupted, leading to the "garbage characters" you saw earlier.
